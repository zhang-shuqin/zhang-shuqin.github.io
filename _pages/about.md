Hi, I am Shuqin Zhang. I have been a postdoc at Fudan University since 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Weixiao Shen. I was a PhD student at Hunan University from 2019 to 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Yingqing Xiao. I visited Prof. Lars Olsen and his analysis group from 2023 to 2024.
My research interests mostly relate to the dimension theory of fractal sets and measures. During my phD, I was mainly working on multifractal and Fourier properties of inhomogeneous self-similar measures.
